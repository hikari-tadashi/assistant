; I guess that I want it to be something other than CRON style? it should check based on 'vibes'
; check my schedule to make sure that it's not bothering me during something
; check my schedule to prompt me before something?
; check device movement (library) to infer if I am resting or not
; - could do this when triggered to check on me, rather than constant monitoring
; check attached (bluetooth) devices & playing music (don't want it to interrput DJ at party!)
; send a message on my watch?

; USE CRON, JUST SAVE TIME
